Thank you for your interest in the David Johnson Foundation grant program.

After careful review by our grant committee, we regret to inform you that your application for "{grant.project_title}" was not selected for funding in this cycle.

This decision does not reflect the value of your project or your commitment to your community. Due to the high volume of applications and limited funding available, we can only approve a small percentage of requests.

We encourage you to:
â€¢ Review our grant guidelines for future alignment with our funding priorities
â€¢ Consider reapplying in future funding cycles (applications typically open quarterly)
â€¢ Explore other funding opportunities that may be a better fit for your project
â€¢ Continue pursuing your important work in the community

While we cannot provide individual feedback on applications, our website contains resources and tips for successful grant applications.

Thank you for your dedication to making a positive impact. We wish you success in your future endeavors.

Best regards,
David Johnson Foundation Review Committee
