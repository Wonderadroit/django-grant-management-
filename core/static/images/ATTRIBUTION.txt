Suggested short attribution (example)
-----------------------------------
Photo: [Photographer Name] on Unsplash â€” https://unsplash.com/photos/<photo-id>

Notes:
- Unsplash images are generally free to use, but the photographer appreciates attribution. Visit the image page (use the Source URL above and remove query params so the URL is `https://unsplash.com/photos/<photo-id>`) to find the photographer's name and profile link.
- If you want, I can attempt to fetch photographer names and append exact credits automatically. I tried earlier but Unsplash photo pages returned 404 from the automated fetch in this environment; I can try again or you can supply preferred credit text.

Direct Unsplash pages (remove query params to visit the photo page and copy photographer name/link):
